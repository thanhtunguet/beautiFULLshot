### 3. Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Framework** | Tauri 2 for native integration + React 19 frontend |
| **State Management** | Zustand (lightweight, minimal boilerplate) |
| **Canvas Rendering** | Konva.js (performant 2D canvas library) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first) |
| **Language** | TypeScript strict mode |
| **Screenshot Library** | xcap (Rust crate) for native captures |
| **Build Tool** | Vite for frontend bundling |

---

### 4. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Launch Time** | < 1s | Cold startup |
| **Capture Speed** | < 500ms | Full-screen capture |
| **Memory Usage** | < 200MB | Typical workflow |
| **Zoom FPS** | 60 FPS | Smooth interaction |
| **Code Coverage** | > 80% | Unit tests |
| **Platform Support** | 3 (macOS, Linux, Windows) | CI/CD validation |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Tauri vs Electron
**Choice:** Tauri 2
**Rationale:**
- Native performance (Rust backend)
- Smaller bundle size (~30MB vs 150MB+)
- Better resource utilization
- macOS, Linux, Windows support
- Growing ecosystem

### Decision 2: Zustand for State
**Choice:** Zustand (not Redux/Context)
**Rationale:**
- Minimal boilerplate
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Perfect for canvas-centric app
- Easy to test and debug
- No wrapper component overhead

### Decision 3: Konva Canvas Library
**Choice:** Konva.js (not Fabric.js or Three.js)
**Rationale:**
- Excellent 2D performance
- Built-in zoom/pan support
- React wrapper (react-konva)
- Supports layers for annotations
- Active maintenance
